# Bounds-for-Banach-Mazur-distance
Mathematica notebooks by M. Korpalski and G. Plebanek for the paper "Bounds for Banach-Mazur distance between some C(K)-spaces".

To use these files, download them and open in Mathematica.

In February 2026, some mistakes were discovered by the authors - some variables in the file Binsearch model.nb had subscripts different than in the paper.
New version corrects these mistakes, giving slightly worse lower bound.
